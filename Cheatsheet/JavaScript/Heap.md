# Heaps
- Binary trees with sorted values:
    - Min-Heap: the root element (top most) must be the minimum value & every child element must be greater than or equal to its parent
    - Max-Heap: the root element (top most) must be the maximum value & every child element must be less than or equal to its parent
- To determine the indices of for parent and child elements:
    - Parent: `(index/2)`, round donw
    - Left Child: `index*2`
    - Right Child: `(index*2) + 1`
      
## Implementing MinHeap
### MinHeap Class
Our MinHeap class will store two pieces of information:
  - An array of elements within the heap.
  - A count of the elements within the heap.
To make our lives easier, weâ€™ll always keep one element at the beginning of the array with the value null. By doing this, we can simplify our coding by always referencing our minimum element at index
 1 instead of 0 and our last element at index `this.size` instead of `this.size - 1`.

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor(){
    this.heap = [null]
    this.size=0
  }
}
module.exports = MinHeap;
```
### Bubble up
- USed to preserve the properties of the MinHeap, i.e when adding a new element, we need to make sure the root element has the minimum values.
- Helper functions: these will help us to perform `**bubbleUp()**` function

```javascript
const getParent = current => Math.floor((current / 2));
const getLeft = current => current * 2;
const getRight = current => current * 2 + 1;
 swap(a, b) {
    [this.heap[a], this.heap[b]] = [this.heap[b], this.heap[a]];
  }
```

- To ensure every child element has greater value than its parents, we continuosly swapping it with its parents until the conditions are met.

```javascript
bubbleUp() {
    let current = this.size;
    while (current > 1 && this.heap[current] < this.heap[getParent(current)]) {
      console.log('..', this.heap);
      console.log(`.. swap index ${current} with ${getParent(current)}`);
      this.swap(current, getParent(current));
      current = getParent(current);
    }
  }
```

### Remove the Min
- To remove the Min in the MinHeap:
  1. Swap the last indext with the first index
  2. Delete the min
  3. Restore the heap properities through Heapify()
 
```javascript
  popMin() {
    if (this.size === 0) {
      return null;
    }
    
    console.log(`\n.. Swap ${this.heap[1]} with last element ${this.heap[this.size]}`);
    this.swap(1, this.size);
    const min = this.heap.pop();
    this.size--;
    console.log(`.. Removed ${min} from heap`);
    console.log('..',this.heap);
    return min;
    
  }
```

### Heapify
- Like `BubbleUp`, `Heapify` is used to maintain the properties of a hash. The only difference is it's moving down instead of moving up
- Helper functions:
  - `canSwap()`:
    - The parent value has to be less than both of its child values.
    - return `true` if swapping can occur for either child. return `false` otherwise

```javascript
canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild) {
  // Check that one of the possible swap conditions exists
  return (this.exists(leftChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[leftChild] 
  || this.exists(rightChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[rightChild]
    );
  }

exists(index) {
    return index <= this.size;
  }
```
- `**Heapify()**` function
  - We need to swap with the child whose value is smaller. This way, we can maintain the properties of the MinHeap
  - If an element has both two children, check to see which child element has smaller value. If `leftChild` is smaller, swap with the `leftChild`. Otherwise, Swap with the `rightChild`
  - If an elenment only has one child, we swap with the `leftChild`

```javascript
heapify() {
    console.log('Heapify');
    let current = 1;
    let leftChild = getLeft(current);
    let rightChild = getRight(current);

    while (this.canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild)) {
      if (this.exists(leftChild) && this.exists(rightChild)){
        if( this.heap[leftChild] > this.heap[rightChild] ){
           this.swap(current, leftChild)
           current = leftChild
        }
        else {
          this.swap(current, rightChild)
          current = rightChild
        } 
      }
      else {
        this.swap(current, leftChild)
        current = leftChild
      }
      leftChild = getLeft(current);
      rightChild = getRight(current);
    }
  }
```

- in `.popMin()` function, add the `.heapify()` before returning the `min` value.

- Complete `MinHeap()` Class

```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [ null ];
    this.size = 0;
  }

  popMin() {
    if (this.size === 0) {
      return null
    }
    console.log(`\n.. Swap ${this.heap[1]} with last element ${this.heap[this.size]}`);
    this.swap(1, this.size);
    const min = this.heap.pop();
    this.size--;
    console.log(`.. Removed ${min} from heap`);
    console.log('..',this.heap);
    this.heapify()
    return min;
  }

  add(value) {
    console.log(`.. adding ${value}`);
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.size++;
    this.bubbleUp();
    console.log(`added ${value} to heap`, this.heap);
  }

  bubbleUp() {
    let current = this.size;
    while (current > 1 && this.heap[getParent(current)] > this.heap[current]) {
      console.log(`.. swap ${this.heap[current]} with parent ${this.heap[getParent(current)]}`);
      this.swap(current, getParent(current));
      console.log('..', this.heap);
      current = getParent(current);
    }
  }

  heapify() {
    console.log('Heapify');
    let current = 1;
    let leftChild = getLeft(current);
    let rightChild = getRight(current);

    while (this.canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild)) {
      if (this.exists(leftChild) && this.exists(rightChild)){
        if( this.heap[leftChild] > this.heap[rightChild] ){
           this.swap(current, leftChild)
           current = leftChild
        }
        else {
          this.swap(current, rightChild)
          current = rightChild
        } 
      }
      else {
        this.swap(current, leftChild)
        current = leftChild
      }
      leftChild = getLeft(current);
      rightChild = getRight(current);
    }
  }

  exists(index) {
    return index <= this.size;
  }

  canSwap(current, leftChild, rightChild) {
    // Check that one of the possible swap conditions exists
    return (
      this.exists(leftChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[leftChild]
      || this.exists(rightChild) && this.heap[current] > this.heap[rightChild]
    );
  }

  swap(a, b) {
    [this.heap[a], this.heap[b]] = [this.heap[b], this.heap[a]];
  }

}

const getParent = current => Math.floor((current / 2));
const getLeft = current => current * 2;
const getRight = current => current * 2 + 1;

module.exports = MinHeap;

```

### What's the maximum swaps for a given set of data?
- Let `N` be the number of the element & `h` be the height of the binary tree (heap)
- Following the formula, we get the maximum swaps: `N = 2**(h+1) -1`
- Since 10000 is between 8191 (h=13) & 16383 (h=14), the maximum swaps can be at most 13
