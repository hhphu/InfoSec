# External Recon & Enumeration Principles
-----

## What are we looking for?
|**Data Point**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`IP Space`|Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.|
|`Domain Information`|Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)|
|`Schema Format`|Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.|
|`Data Disclosures`|For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain `intranet` site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)|
|`Breach Data`|Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.|

## Where are we looking ?
|**Resource**|**Examples**|
|---|---|
|`ASN / IP registrars`|[IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)|
|`Domain Registrars & DNS`|[Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as `8.8.8.8`.|
|`Social Media`|Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization.|
|`Public-Facing Company Websites`|Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.|
|`Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces`|[GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)|
|`Breach Data Sources`|[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.|

#### Finding Address Spaces
[BGP-Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/) is commonly known for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN reside within.

#### DNS Enumeration
[viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) & [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/)


## Sample Enumeration Process

- Check for ASN/IP & Domain Data using [BGP-Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/)
	confirm with viewdns.info (or command line: `nslookup ns1.inlanefreight.com`)
- Hunting information using Goolge dorking
	Files: filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com
	Emails: intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com 
- Harvesting usernames
	Use [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last,etc.)
- Credentials Huting
	[Dehashed](https://dehashed.com/) can be used for hunting cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data.
	```bash
	sudo python3 dehased.py -q inlanefreight.local -p
	```

# INITIAL ENUMERTAION OF THE DOMAIN

#### Key Data Points
|**Data Point**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AD Users`|We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.|
|`AD Joined Computers`|Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc.|
|`Key Services`|Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS|
|`Vulnerable Hosts and Services`|Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)|

### Identify Hosts
- We can use `Wireshark` & `TCPDump` to put our listen to the network.
```bash 
sudo -E wireshark
```

- ARP packets will help us discover hosts.

- For hosts without GUI, we can use `tcpdump`, `net-creds` and `NetMiner`
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i ens224
```

- Use `Responder` to analyze network traffic and determine if anything else in the domain pops up.
```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 -A
```

- Use `FPing` for Active Checks
```bash
 fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

- The above command validates which hosts are active.

- Nmap Scanning
```bash
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /hosts-enum
```

### Identify Users
#### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration
- We can use jsmith.txt or jsmith2.txt from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
- We can download [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/tag/v1.0.3) for the tool for testing from Linux.
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git
# Show help menu
make help
# compile one each for use of Linux, Windows and Mac
sudo make all 
```

- Test the Kerbrute 
```bash
./kerbrute_linux_amd64
# Adding the Tool to our Path
Move the Binary to PATH
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_am64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute
```

- Run Kerbrute to enumerate users
```bash
kerbrute username -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc $IP jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
```

#### Identify Potential Vulnerabilities
- [local system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is built-in account in Widows that has the highest privileges. A `SYSTEM` account on a domain-joined host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account.
- There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host:
	- Remote Windows exploits (MS08-067, EternalBlue, BlueKeep)
	- Abusing services running in the context of `SYSTEM` account / abusing service account `SeImpersonate` privileges using [Juicy Potato] (https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato)
	- Local Privilege Escalation
	- Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with local account and using Psexec to launch SYSTEM cmd window
