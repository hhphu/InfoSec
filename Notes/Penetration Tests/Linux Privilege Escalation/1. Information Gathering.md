# Environment Enumeration
-----

### Basic commands
- `whoami` - what user are we running as
- `id` - what groups does our user belong to?
- `hostname` - what is the server named. can we gather anything from the naming convention?
- `ifconfig` or `ip -a` - what subnet did we land in, does the host have additional NICs in other subnets?
- `sudo -l` - can our user run anything with sudo (as another user as root) without needing a password? This can sometimes be the easiest win and we can do something like `sudo su` and drop right into a root shell.

### Get more details
- Check OS and version
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```
- Check current user's PATH
```bash
echo $PATH
```
- Check out all environment variables
```bash
env
```
- Retrieve kernel versions
```bash
uname -a
```
- Retrieve CPU type/version
```bash
lscpu
```
- Find what login shells exist on the server
```bash
cat /etc/shells
```
- Check to see if any defenses are in place
```bash
exec shield
iptables
AppArmor
SELinux
Fail2ban
Snort
Uncomplicated Firewall
```
- Enumerate block devices on the system
```bash
lsblk
```
- Find information about any printers attached to the system.
```bash
lpstat
```
- Check for mounted & unmounted drives
```bash
cat /etc/fstab
```
- Check for routing table
```bash
route
OR
netstat -rn
```
- Check to see if the host is configured to use internal DNS
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
- Check other hosts the target has communicated with
```bash
arp -a
```
- Check out `passwd` file
```bash
cat /etc/passwd

$USERNAME:$PASSWORD:UID:GID:USERID_INFO:HOME_DIRECTORY:SHELL
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```
- Several hashes can be used in Linux systems. These are some common hashes:
	Salted MD5: `$1$...`
	SHA-256: `$5$...`
	SHA-512: `$6$...`
	BCrypt: `$2a$...`
	Scrypt: `$7$...`
	Argon2: `$argon2i$...`
- Check which users have login shells. Some versions of shells have vulnerabilities and we can exploit them
```bash
grep "*sh$" /etc/passwd
```
- Enumerate groups
```bash
cat /etc/group
```
- Use `getent` to get members of any group
```bash
getent group sudo
```

### Mounted File Systems
- A mounted file system is attached to and accessed through a directory on at system. 
- Mounting a file system allows users to access the files and folders stored on that system, which usually requires root privileges.
```bash
df -h
```
- When a file is unmounted, it is no longer accessible by the system. Reason = some files/scrips/documents store sensitive data. With root privileges, we can mount those files and retrieve information.

### Unmounted File Systems
```bash
cat /etc/fstab | grep -v "#" | column -t
```

- Find hidden files
```bash
find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep htb-student
```
- Find hidden directories
```bash
find / -type d -name ".*" -ls 2>/dev/null
```

- Temporary files
```bash
ls -l /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm

# Both /tmp and /var/tmp are used to store temporary data. 
# The data retention for /tmp is much shorter than the of of /var/tmp
```

- In real world, we should run scripts like [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) and [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)

# Linux Services & Internals Enumeration
-----

### Basic commands
- Network interface: `ip a`
- Hosts: `cat /etc/hosts`
- Users' last logins: `lastlog`
- Logged in user: `w`
- Command history: `history`
- Find History Files: 
```bash
find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/nul
```
- cron: `ls -la /etc/cron.daily`
- proc
	- Proc filesystem (proc/procfs): virtual files contain information about system, processes, hardware, etc.
```bash
find /proc -name cmdlin -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"
```
- Services
```bash
apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list
```
- Sudo version: `sudo -V`
- Binaries: `ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/`
- GTFObins
```bash
for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done
```
- Track system calls and signal processing
```bash
strace ping -c1 $IP
```
- Configuration Files
```bash
find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

- Scripts
```bash
find / -type f -name "*.sh*" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share"
```
- Running services by user: `ps aux | grep root`

# Credentials Hunting
-----
- A common example of MySQL database credentials within WordPress configuration files:
```bash
cat wp-config.php | grep 'DB_USER\|DB_PASSWORD'
```
- The spool or mail directories, if accessible, can also contain valuable information or even credentials
```bash
find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -iname "*config*" -type f 2>/dev/null
```
- SSH keys: `ls ~/.ssh`
