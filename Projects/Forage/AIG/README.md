# Interview tip
“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in AIG's job simulation on the Forage platform, gaining
valuable insights into what it's like to be part of a cybersecurity team at
AIG. 
I worked on a project to create a cyber threat analysis simulation, delving into
the possible vulnerabilities and how to fix them. I practiced using tools and
languages relevant to cybersecurity such as Python, building my skills in a
real-world context. 
This experience confirmed my passion for addressing cybersecurity challenges,
and I'm enthusiastic about applying these skills on AIG's cybersecurity team to
contribute to solving real-world problems.
