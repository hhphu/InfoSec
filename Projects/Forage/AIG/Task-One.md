1. The [first advisory Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-356a), outlines a serious vulnerability in one of the world’s most popular logging software.
2. The [second advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-fbi-nsa-and-international-partners-issue-advisory-ransomware-trends-2021) explores how ransomware has been increasing and is becoming professionalized - a concern for a large company like AIG.
