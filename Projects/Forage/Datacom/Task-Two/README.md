# Task 2: Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Background
Here is the background information on your task
Congratulations on successfully completing the first task!

Your initial research on the APT group is a crucial step because it helps to identify the potential attackers and their methods, motives and targets. Understanding the TTPs of APT34 helps identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could be exploited. 

This has laid a solid foundation for the next task, which is to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the client. The client has a fence around the perimeter of its property and a padlock on its entrance gate to prevent unauthorised access. However, the leadership team is concerned about potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of its information and systems. They require a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in their system or network.

As a cybersecurity consultant, you understand that conducting a risk assessment is an essential component of any effective cybersecurity strategy. This involves identifying, evaluating and prioritising potential security threats and vulnerabilities to determine the level of risk and develop a plan to mitigate those risks. During the risk assessment, you will need to identify the assets that need to be protected, define the risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios. You will assess the risk ratings for each scenario, both with and without existing measures in place. Finally, you will provide a risk assessment report to the client summarising your findings and recommendations for mitigating risks and improving the institution's security posture.

The goal of the risk assessment is to help the client prioritise and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise risks. This will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information and systems, as well as protect their reputation and financial resources. Ultimately, your work will help the client comply with regulatory and legal requirements and standards and provide peace of mind knowing that their security is being handled by a knowledgeable and experienced cybersecurity expert.

## Tasks
In this task, you will be documenting the client's risk position using the padlock analogy as an example. The client wants you to help them define the context, assess their risk matrix and identify potential risk scenarios.

To complete this task, you will need to:

1. Define the context – Identify the assets that need to be protected. This could include sensitive information, customer data, financial information or any other critical assets that are important to the client.

2.Define the risk matrix – Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario. The likelihood is the probability of the risk scenario occurring, while the consequence is the severity of the potential impact. The risk rating is a measure of the overall risk posed by the scenario, calculated by multiplying the likelihood and consequence.
3. Define three risk scenarios – Identify the specific risks that the client is trying to protect their assets from. For example, a cyberattack, natural disaster or employee negligence.

4. Assess risk rating for each risk scenario – Calculate the inherent risk rating for each scenario, assuming there are no measures in place to reduce the risk (without fence and padlock in place).

5. Assess risk rating for each risk scenario with existing measures – Calculate the current risk rating for each scenario taking existing measures in place to reduce the risk into consideration (with fence and padlock in place).

6. Assess risk levels for each risk scenario with additional measures – Identify any additional measures that could be put in place to further reduce the risk. Calculate the target risk rating for each scenario with these additional measures in place.

7. Create a risk assessment report for the client that summarises the risk assessment findings, the risk mitigation strategy and any recommended measures for implementation.

You will need to use the "Risk Assessment Template" provided in the Resources section below to complete this task. 

It's important to keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer. The solution may vary depending on the specific context and scenarios presented. Good luck!
