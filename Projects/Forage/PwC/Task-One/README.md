# Task One: Integrated Information Defense

Boldi AG is a family-owned business in Switzerland with around 90 employees. They are a premium component supplier for the chemical industry, they have 4 people in IT and hire external IT consultants now and then.

Last night the news had a story about a competitor who was hit by a severe ransomware attack. Wake-up call for Boldi AG: their last information risk analysis was conducted in 2014. Management has decided to ask top consultancies to pitch their cybersecurity services.

The team needs your help to prepare a convincing pitch presentation. But first, Stefan, your team leader on this assignment, sets up a call together with you and the Boldi AG management to get more information. They mention, they have heard of the concept of layered, integrated defense but would like to know more about how it works.

You're happy to jump in and explain together with Stefan that integrated defense is a universal concept that applies to deliberate attacks and non-intentional threats such as acts of nature. A layered approach to Boldi AG’s information security would involve classification from the innermost layer of vital assets, core functions, processes, data and information to the public-facing boundary points. These interlocking layered strategies, tactical procedures and operational details would reduce the potential impact of information risks.

Then, referring to the recent attack on Boldi AG’s competitor, you warn management that there are three dangers/biases that they need to be aware of:
- ignoring “blind spots” in their defenses,
- blindly trusting in their systems, processes, and people, plus
- not checking up to see if these are actually working correctly.

Boldi AG thanks you, and the call ends.

You're about to meet with our Cybersecurity team to set up workflows for preparing the pitch, when you see that a manager at Boldi AG has left you a voicemail message:

```
“Hi, after considering the dangers you flagged, we’ve identified a potential blind spot. We have been storing our back-up systems images and database back-ups at an offsite facility that is not monitored 24/7. This means that we cannot exclude with 100% certainty that unauthorised persons could enter that facility. Feel free to call me if you have any questions. Thanks.”
```

A bit surprised, you and Stefan call back to remind Boldi AG management of the absolute minimum of information security best practices:

physically protect information systems
control access by all users
control disclosure and disposal of information
train all staff regularly
To wrap up the call, you explain that in a broader sense information security must be actively managed. A risk management framework can provide top-down guidance to organisations in setting the necessary organisational attitude and mindset.


## Tasks:
- Submit a PowerPoint set including both parts below:

### Part 1:
We need to consider the information provided in the voicemail. Please differentiate first due care from due diligence for information risk management. Afterwards, use your new knowledge to analyse what Boldi AG did wrong. Was it due care, due diligence or both? 

Our Cybersecurity team will include your findings in the final pitch presentation with your detailed explanation.

### Part 2: 
Based on the key principles of defense, what basic options does Boldi AG have for limiting or containing damage from risk?
