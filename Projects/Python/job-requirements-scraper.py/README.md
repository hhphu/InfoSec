- This project utilizes Python BeautifulSoup to scrape job descriptions from multiple listings on LinkedIn. Each of the job description will be saved into a CSV file, which will then be used for ChatGPT to anylyze the most demanded skills for particular positions.

- To use this script, simply replace the value of URL variable. This URL can be obtain after performing a job search on LinkedIn.

- For example, when I put "Security Engineer" as the title and "Los Angeles, CA", the resulting URL was "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=Security%20Engineer&location=Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA&geoId=100623241&trk=public_jobs_jobs-search-bar_search-submit&position=1&pageNum=0"
