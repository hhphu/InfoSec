# AWS: Cloud 101

## Introduction
This room is intended to provide users who are not familiar with cloud technologies insight into some of the cloud's unique characteristics. Students in the room will learn about:
- How current cloud capabilities evolved from humble beginnings at AWS and other early internet companies.
- Why cloud technologies have changed how individuals and corporations interact with IT infrastructure.
- How business (non-tech) benefits have helped drive cloud adoption.
- Free resources and documentation that AWS has created for the public.
This information will help you become familiar with AWS even if you have never used a single cloud technology. These tasks will help you understand the broader story arc of where the cloud has been, is, and, therefore...where the cloud may be going.

## Notes
- Region: physical locations of AWS' clusters of data centers
- Availability Zone: multiple AWS data centers within a region, which can not be more than 60 miles apart.

### Data Severieignty
Diffrent countries have different laws and regulations regarding how Amazon store data. Data are also categorized based on their confidentiality level.

### Operational Expenses vs Capital Expenses
- Capital Expenses: major monetary spent on goods & services for the company to operate in a long period of times
- Operational Expenses: incurred as part of day-to-day operations, which vary.

### API mandate
- All teams within Amazon must communicate through APIs. These APIs must be usable for both Amazon employees and external users.
- The Two Pizza Team: Jeff try to enforce collaborations within teams, which requires smaller team size.
  
```bash
"We try not to create teams larger than can be fed by two pizzas"
```

### Serverless Services
- Low-code/No-code solutions: allow users to perform certain tasks with minimum configurations.
- Cost less compared to traditional resources.
