## CSRF Overview

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability on web applications where attackers take advantage of the victims' identities to make malicious requests, usually through browsers that has the victims' cookies attached to.

There are three phases of a CSRF attack:

- Attackers have knowledge of the traffics on the applications (hence they can craft malicious payloads for the exploit)
- The victims' identities are confirmed on the websites, usually through the cookies transmitted throughout multiple domains.
- The lack of security implementations on the websites that prevent attackers making unauthorized requests on behalf of the victims.

### CSRF Effect

- A successful CSRF can result in unauthorized access to users' data, leading to information disclosure. Attackers can also manipulate users' information for specific purposes.
- Stealthy exploitation: Attackers can leverage CSRF and use it as a stepping stone for other attacks to further exploit the applications.

## Types of CSRF attacks

### Traditional CSRF
- Traditional CSRF focuses on the state-changing of the application by submiting forms.

1. A user authenticates to the banking application
2. The attacker crafts a malicious link and send it to the user. This malicious link contains the actions the attacker wants to perform on the application under the user's identity.
3. The user open the email on the same browser and clicks the link.
4. The unauthorized action is performeed (transfering money to the attacker's account) using the victim's cookies.

### XMLHttpRequest CSRF
An asynchronous CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack occurs when an attacker forces a victim’s browser to make an unauthorized request without requiring a full page reload. Instead of using a traditional HTML form submission, these attacks leverage JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest (XHR) or the Fetch API to send requests in the background—just like modern web applications do for smoother user experiences.

Example: assume a user is using an email service `mailbox.thm`, which allows him/her to update email forwarding settings without refreshing the page. The service uses an API endpoint:

```bash
POST mailbox.thm/api/updateEmail
```

A legitimate request from a logged-in user might look like this:

```javascript
fetch("https://mailbox.thm/api/updateEmail", {
  method: "POST",
  credentials: "include",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ forwardTo: "mynewemail@example.com" })
});
```

If the email service does not have CSRF protection, an attacker can exploit this behavior.

1. The user logs into `mailbox.thm`, which results in the browser's storing an authenticated session cookie for `mailbox.thm`
2. The attacker tricks the victim into clicking a malicious links, which executes JavaScript codes. The script may look like this:

```javascript
fetch("https://mailbox.thm/api/updateEmail", {
  method: "POST",
  credentials: "include",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ forwardTo: "attacker@example.com" })
});
```
3. Since the web malcious web page is open in the same browser that stores the user's authenticated session cookie for `mailbox.thm`, the request is processed as if it's coming from a legitimate user.
4. The attacker now has access to the victim's emails.

-> `d`

**Does the attacker usually know the web application requests and response format while launching a CSRF attack (yea/nay)?**

-> `yea`
