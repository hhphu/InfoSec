## Scalar
- A scalar is a single quantity that you can think of as a number.

```
x=5
```

## vector
- Vectors are arrays of numbers

```
x = np.array([1,2,3])
```

## Matrix
- Grids of information with rows and columns. We can index a matrix just like an array

```
x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
```

## Tensor
- Data structure used in deep learning.
- Allows flexibility with the type of data we're using
