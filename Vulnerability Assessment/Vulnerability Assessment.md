# Methodology
- 8 steps to performing a Network Vulnerability Assessment
	- **Conduct Risk Identification and Analysis:** Identify all assets that are  parts of an information system in a company
	- **Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policies:** The policy or a procedure should have an official owner that is responsible for everything that is written inside. This should be approved by upper management.
	- **Identify the type of scans:** Determine the type of scan to be performed depending on the software that is running on the systems.
	- **Configure the Scan:** add a list of target IPs, define port ranges and protocols, define the targets, and set up the aggressiveness of the scane, time & notifications.
	- **Perform the scan:** The scanning tooll will fingerprint the sepcified targets to gather basic informationa bout them. With this information, the tool will proceed to enumerate the targets and gather more detailed specifications suc as ports and services that are up and running.
	- **Evaulate and consider possible risks:** Risks associated with performing a vulnerability scan pertain mostly to the availability of the target system. If the links and connections cannot handle the traffic load generated by the scan, the remote target can shut down and become unavailable.
	- **Interpret the Scan Results**: If ther eis a public exploit available for a vulnerability that you found in your system, giving priority to thet vulnerability.
	- **Create a remediation and mitigation plan:** Information security staff should prioritize the mitigation of each vulnerability. The informaiton security staff and IT staff need to communicate and work closely together in the vulnerability mitigataion phase in order to streamline the resolution process.
